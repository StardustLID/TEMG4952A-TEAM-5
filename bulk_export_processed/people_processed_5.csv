He began working in the cleaning and restoration business in the early 1980’s. He soon saw a need for quality cleaning and restoration businesses. In response to this need, he opened Super Steamer in 1986. His clients immediately noticed the difference, and Super Steamer quickly began to grow. As he continued to serve the community, Rene noticed more and more of Super’s customers were in need of a quality emergency service company. So in 1996, Super Steamer evolved into Super Restoration. Since then, Super Restoration’s success has been built around the same core values Rene has focused on from the start. Today, Super Restoration has the cleanest trucks, newest available technology and provides the best service. But Mr. Vargas ensures that his premium service is affordable, offering the same prices or better than his competitors. Always focused on the needs of his community, Rene is helping to provide high-quality restoration service by spending much of his time working with others who are building their own restoration business. With each and every one, he stresses the same principles and core values."

Most recently, she was General Counsel of a patent enforcement firm based out of Irvine, CA that invests in intellectual property, life sciences, and other developed technologies. As the firm's New York-based General Counsel, Meredith drove management's legal efforts to help build an investment platform for the acquisition of mature technology and biotech companies, as well as other absolute return assets. She managed a team of licensing and patent attorneys and was responsible for leading deal teams and governance campaigns in major domestic and international mergers and acquisitions, including a ~ US$275mm secondary portfolio of life sciences assets. Some of the assets in that portfolio acquisition included companies developing cutting-edge technologies in the fight against COVID-19.  Prior to her work in technology transactions, Meredith Simmons led Telmarine LLC (f/k/a Thistle Partners LLC), which was her own hedge fund and private equity consulting practice. She guided her clients through fund formation best-practices, provided transactional support, and drafted regulatory, political, and policy research in both U.S. and European markets. Meredith also consulted with top private equity and social enterprise funds. During this time, she also served as interim Chief Operating Officer to Ziba Capital Management LLC, a governance-oriented hedge fund start-up led by two accomplished investment professionals. Meredith's success with Telmarine LLC (f/k/a Thistle Partners LLC) was influenced by her time working at Mason Capital Management, LLC as their first-ever Chief Compliance Officer & General Counsel. Here, she created a legal and regulatory program and advised partners and key stakeholders on trading, regulatory, political, employment, and tax policy matters. Meredith's other notable accomplishments at Mason include: managing outside counsel on key governance transactions and litigations; leading the team in creating an affiliated broker-dealer (Mason Capital Group, LLC); and liaising with major counterparties. Earlier in Meredith Simmons' career, she worked at Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, Inc., as well as several major domestic and international law firms, including Holland & Knight, LLP; Winston & Strawn, LLP; and Epstein Becker & Green, PC. While at Epstein Becker & Green, Meredith served as a long-term secondee to Royal Bank of Scotland's Global Banking and Market's division and discovered a renewed passion for transactional work and a new passion for regulatory compliance.  Meredith is also a committed philanthropist. She serves as Board Member of Crossroads Community Services, Inc., a Midtown Manhattan soup kitchen, women’s shelter, and choice pantry, and the BecomingX Foundation, a U.S. and U.K.-based educational philanthropy committed to helping children all over the world achieve their highest potential. Meredith is also a Board Member for the International Institute in Spain, a 120-year-old American educational institution in the heart of Madrid connecting Spanish and American culture and is also dedicated to the educational advancement of women. Outside of these endeavors, Meredith Simmons is a dedicated amateur equestrian. Learning to ride as an adult has taught her a lot about resilience and the importance of always getting back on the horse. Additionally, she is a 15x marathoner. While she no longer runs, her favorite race will always be the 2013 New York City marathon, which she completed alongside her brother to help raise funds for the NYRR Team for Kids. Meredith graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of California. She later received a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. and completed her education with a Masters of Law from New York University School of Law, where she served as an articles editor on the Journal of Law and Business."

More recently he created a bunch of fun shows which had wildly unprofitable runs in NYC.  He didn't lose a lot of money, it's just that there was no chance he would ever make any money.  He even kicked off the first serious attempt at improv over video conferencing in 2014, way before the pandemic made it fashionable, with a website called E-MPROV. After that, he took some shows on the road to colleges and regional theaters and managed to make some money!  He also traveled to teach workshops and classes, worked as a consultant to regional improv theaters, and worked at corporations leading improv-based professional development workshops and events. He is a passionate believer in the power and beauty of improv comedy.  He deeply believes the world would be a better place if everyone had done a little improv."

Yui recognized that one of the biggest discrepancies in the industry was the distribution of commissions. In his opinion, there had to be a better way, so HouseRebate and its motto, “share the wealth” were born. With HouseRebate, buyers receive a rebate of up to 1% on the purchase price of the home, while sellers can list their home for as low as 4.5% and still obtain full service. Both benefit from HouseRebate’s MLS database that contains addresses and pictures of homes, as well as neighborhood information and sales comparables. Yui knew that he was in a unique position to bring a new level of sophistication to his profession. Having served as a senior executive for leading real estate companies like Sunroad Enterprises and The Dermot Company, Yui had first-hand knowledge of the business side of the industry. As a seasoned real estate investor, he was intimately familiar with the frustration encountered by many homebuyers and sellers. Prior to obtaining his real estate broker’s license, Yui spent five years at Coopers Lybrand (now Price Waterhouse Coopers) as a Certified Public Accountant. He holds an M.B.T. degree from the University of Southern California and a B.S. degree from the University of California, Berkeley. In his spare time, Yui enjoys traveling, kayaking, cooking, yoga and performing charity work.

In 2011, Amber responded to the rising childhood obesity crisis by starting the nonprofit Food Literacy Center to inspire children to eat their vegetables.

Amber uniquely understands the audience she’s serving, and designed a behavior change model to meet the needs of those at highest risk for diet-related disease. Within just two months of food literacy classes, the nonprofit changes kids’ attitudes towards healthy foods—the first step towards long-term behavior change. With two decades of management experience serving health-based nonprofits, Amber has raised $6.5 million for local charities. Known for putting vision to action, she has led Food Literacy Center’s dramatic growth: expanding from 1 school to 9 in only five years, and poised to open a 5,000 square foot cooking school and active learning garden in partnership with Sacramento City Unified School District on the community’s Leataata Floyd Elementary School campus—a project slated to open in late 2020.

In 1976, he started Software Dynamics, a systems software house, where he designed compilers, time-sharing and distributed network operating systems. The similarity in concepts and dissimilarity in implementation of the various OSes suggested that managing designs was key to managing long-lived software systems, and turned Ira's interests towards deeper software engineering research.

En primer lugar, les recuerdo que no sobrecargar nuestro texto con detalles es el concepto, la trama es lo principal. Sin embargo, conocer las situaciones en las que se desarrollan las historias es necesario para que el lector se sitúe y comprenda el ritmo de la narración. Podemos hacerlo de forma objetiva cuando describimos los paisajes, representando cada rasgo tal cual es sin nombrar las emociones o sensaciones, y utilizando varios adjetivos, como: Hay varios lagos pequeños en La Mancha. Parte del agua es muy salada, rodeada de escasa vegetación. La vegetación en algunas regiones es muy árida. Debemos agregar las sensaciones que estas condiciones crean en nosotros al describir subjetivamente (el autor o el personaje). EJEMPLO: Ocentejo: Agradable y secreto lugar en medio de un hermoso paisaje, entre huertos, arboledas y frondosos nogales centenarios, con restos del antiguo castillo en la cima de la pequeña colina que lo sostiene - del que fue la señora María de Albornoz; minúscula fortaleza calificada por Layna Serrano como ''liliputiense''. El uso de fotos o dibujos de los lugares donde queremos crear nuestras historias y hacerlo de manera organizada es un proceso exitoso. Comenzamos por dar una visión general primero, y luego pasamos a través de las partes: elementos del primer plano, la derecha, la izquierda, el arriba, el abajo, el frente, el fondo, etc. Un ejemplo sería:  El Ayuntamiento, un edificio encalado con un largo balcón en el segundo piso y ventanas enrejadas en el primer piso, estaba al final de la plaza. La inscripción CASA CONSISTORIAL se podía leer junto a la puerta de piedra, en letras doradas. La plaza estaba rodeada por las fachadas encaladas de unas doce casas de dos pisos, con sus balcones y ventanas llenas de geranios y claveles. Había grupos de personas de todas las edades en los balcones iluminados, y junto a las puertas de las casas, con rostros atentos y emocionados. En el centro de la plaza, frente al Ayuntamiento, los ojos de todo el pueblo se dirigían hacia una plataforma que habían erigido. En el escenario, y en las tenues luces de la calle, la multitud animaba con su música en la calurosa y húmeda noche de julio. Sentados en el escenario, los niños escuchaban con gran atención. Las estrellas brillaban en lo alto. Cualquier consejo debe ser considerado cuando se trata de describir: 1) Observen y escojan los datos más significativos con mucho cuidado. 2) Organizar los detalles de forma ordenada: - De lo general a lo único, o al contrario. - Del primer plano, o al revés, al fondo. - O al revés, del interior al exterior. - De izquierda a derecha, o al contrario. Hay que posicionar los objetos en la habitación con precisión al explicar, usando expresiones como derecha, al lado de abajo, detrás, en el medio, alrededor, etc. Les dejo aquí una dirección web con descripciones de los componentes que componen ciertos edificios y que pueden ser útiles para explicarlos. Espero que sea útil."

A single-family office structure from which Fredrick stewards his family’s assets. He is also the Chairman of the Board for the New York City–based foundation, The Scott Family Foundation Intl., a Civil Society Organization (CSO). Fredrick is a business consultant, private equity investor, motivational speaker, social activist, and philanthropist. Named one of Ebony magazine’s “Top 30 Under 30” in May 2010 at the age of 25, Scott was, at the time, the youngest African American hedge fund founder in history. The former Wall Street wunderkind is now ready to revolutionize the economic development landscape in the minority community.  A sought-after financial expert, Fredrick has appeared on TVOne’s “Washington Watch” with Roland Martin, New York’s Hot 97-FM and the Warren Ballentine Show. He’s spoken at the annual conferences for the National Action Network, the National Bankers Association, the Jackie Robinson Foundation, and the renowned Eagle Academy. Fredrick is the quintessential definition of “failing your way to success”. Though never indicted, due to unfortunate and perplexing circumstances, Fredrick plead guilty to a “white collar” crime and spent nearly 5 years of his life inside the Federal Prison system in the United States. That experience changed his life and gave him an eye-opening realization of what it truly means to be “Black in America”.  Fredrick is a strong proponent for the advancement of financial literacy initiatives in disadvantaged communities and teaches financial literacy courses online, where he provides information, answers questions and supplies resources free of charge. An advocate for better race relations in the United States and the ending of policing and incarceration tactics which disproportionately effect communities of color; Fredrick candidly discusses the implicit cognitive biases in the Justice and Correctional Systems and enumerates factual, data driven conclusions on its effects on the sociological and economic constructs of the United States. In 2009, he served as the Founder and CEO of ACI Capital Group, LLC, an S.E.C. registered Investment Advisory Firm that, according to regulatory filings, had 3.7 billion dollars in assets under management. Here he was responsible for all investment banking, advisory, and operational matters. A Muslim by faith, Scott has lived and traveled extensively abroad and is fluent in Italian. Fredrick received his education from Harvard University (via edx.org), he holds the Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA) Certification, Capital Markets & Securities Analyst (CMSA) Certification and is a Certified Banking & Credit Analyst (CBCA) all of which he received from the Corporate Finance Institute (CFI). He also received his Diploma in Islamic Finance from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)."

Similarly, I took an active role in educating people on how to evaluate the viability of public industrial companies based on performance and ethical factors.

Her father started a business with a $500 loan and when he sold it to Kraft Foods in 1986, it was one of the Top 50 food distributors in the US. This experience was the road map that empowered her to explore the unlimited possibilities, take risks, solve problems, and continually innovate in order to build a successful business from the ground up. “One of my father’s biggest challenges was that he considered federal government interference by OSHA, DOT, EPA with his private company to be intrusive and difficult to comply with,” says Ms. Craig. Although he strongly believed in maintaining a safe work environment, he was not happy with the increasing number of regulations and continuous mandates that the government imposed on him.  As she reflected on what she learned from her father, she thought “What if I could build a company that would simplify safety for other companies that were confused and overwhelmed by the same type of government regulations?”  And that is where Craig Safety Technologies, Inc. got it’s start.  In answer to her question of how to help companies to manage their compliance."

Marcus led Aston Aunties to victory in the National University eSports Championship during 2015. ​ Career   Marcus Raiyat has previous experience at a $245billion pension fund (Phoenix Group), and professional competencies learned through the Chartered Institute of Securities and Investment Management (CISI).

He specialises in Portfolio Management, Quantitative Analysis, and CFD Trading, where he has profitably traded multiple asset classes for over a Decade advocating his method of trading less than once a week. Marcus Raiyat's key Principles: ​ As traders, we are slaves to volatility. If the market doesn't move, we have no opportunities. We, therefore, must understand what is driving the price through fundamental analysis, and use historical volatility assessments to determine the risk-adjusted pay-off on all of our trades. Self-discipline, goal setting, and self-reflection will be the three main skills that determine whether your approach to the market allows you to gain profit.   You can't use just one 'type' of analysis to make money trading. You need a multi-dimensional approach using Fundamentals, Technicals and Business Cycle methods. If you miss one of those factors, the odds of making money are reduced to zero."

The GVCS is a set of 50 most important machines that it takes for modern life to exist – everything from a tractor, to an oven, to a circuit maker. Marcin and his team are producing open source blueprints – so that anyone can build and maintain machines at a fraction of what it costs today. His goal is to create a life size LEGO set of powerful, self-replicating production tools – that can decentralized production – to build modern prosperity in local economies. He imagines the raw power this gives to people – to tap autonomy, mastery, and purpose – towards rebuilding their communities and solving wicked problems. Marcin believes that true freedom – the most essential type of freedom – starts with peoples’ individual ability to use natural resources to free themselves from material constraints – to unleash human potential. He founded Open Source Ecology in 2003 in order to make closed-loop manufacturing a reality. The mission of Open Source Ecology is to create a collaborative economic platform that optimizes development, production, and distribution – via open source collaboration – to accelerate innovation to unprecedented levels. These ideas are being tested at the Factor e Farm (e as in the mathematical constant) in rural Missouri. Marcin was recognized on the Enrich List, has been called an Innovation Stuntman, a Disruptive Hero, and gained the distinctions of a 2012 TED Senior Fellow, a 2013 Shuttleworth Foundation Fellow, and a 2013 White House Champion of Change. The Global Village Construction Set was recognized in Time Magazine’s Best Inventions of 2012. He came to the U.S. from Poland as a child. He graduated with honors from Princeton University and earned his Ph.D. in fusion physics from the University of Wisconsin. After receiving formal education, he found himself useless in solving wicked problems, and started a farm in rural Missouri – which was to become the birthplace of the GVCS."

With that gesture in 1928, Mr. Ehrlich established his new service company using the principles that still guide Ehrlich today: initiative, ingenuity and exceeding customer expectations. In these early days, the service team consisted of Mr. Ehrlich, his wife and daughter, who placed rat bait in small pieces of bread.

Mel Bay was born in the Missouri town of Bunker and raised in DeSoto where as a teenager he taught himself how to play the guitar and performed regularly with various Ozark region bands. His plans to study engineering in college were brought to a halt by the Depression. Upon moving to St. Louis, Mel took up the tenor banjo and became a highly sought after musician and teacher. He began writing guitar methods in 1947. His method books grew in popularity worldwide and laid the foundation for most of today's guitar pedagogy. Guitar Player magazine referred to him as ''the George Washington of the guitar.'' It is difficult to find a guitarist worldwide who has not, at some point, studied one of Mel's method books. Sales of his Modern Guitar Method series are estimated to be well in excess of 20 million copies. Mr. Bay received many awards during his career which include the ''Lifetime Achievement Award'' from the Guitar Foundation of America, ''Lifetime Achievement Award'' from the Retail Print Music Dealers Association, the ''Owen Miller Lifetime Achievement Award'' from the American Federation of Musicians, ''Certificate of Merit'' from the St. Louis Music Educators Association, a resolution from the Missouri House of Representatives honoring his achievements, a proclamation by mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. making October 25, 1996 ''Mel Bay Day'' in the city of St. Louis and a letter of commendation from President Clinton. June 30, 2011, Melbourne (Mel) E. Bay was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Mel Bay established the structure for modern guitar education and by so doing, laid the foundation for the continued growth and advancement of the instrument. See also the biography of Mel Bay elsewhere on this site. A full biography of Mel Bay in book form is also available, entitled The Mel Bay Story, by Ray Dankenbring.

Since participating in Japan's first electronic journal platform project started by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (currently the Japan Science and Technology Agency) in 1999, we have been providing academic-related Web services to this day. We are developing and providing it. In 2012, it was reborn as a company specializing in academic-related Web services under the corporate philosophy of ''contributing to the development of academic communication and academic research through IT'' by separating other non-academic-related services as a separate company. It was. The business, which started from the digitization service of treatises 20 years ago, has expanded to support academic conferences and secretariat support services, and as of the end of 2018, more than 300 academic societies and research institutes have used our services. I have received it. Japan, which is not blessed with natural resources, aims to become a ''science and technology creation nation'' and promotes it (Science and Technology Basic Law), but the environment surrounding researchers and their communities cuts the budget. , The number of members is decreasing year by year. As a result, the time that researchers can spend on their original research is becoming shorter and shorter. In the Japanese academic world in such an environment, we will use this as an opportunity to review the business practices and practices that have continued for a long time, and realize an environment where researchers can spend more time on research while reducing total costs. We have planned and developed IT services. And from now on, our stance based on our corporate philosophy of ''contributing to the development of academic communication and academic research through IT'' will not change consistently. As a company specializing in academia, we will continue to strive to be an industry professional more than anywhere else. And I would like to continue the business in order to increase the time that researchers can use for their main business research, even if it is 1 minute or 1 second. After working for several IT companies, I joined Atlas in 2001 and have consistently been engaged in the academic services department. The environment surrounding the academic world is harsh, but I believe that by taking the plunge and changing the way we used to be, we can still respond to that environment and continue to develop the academic world. Atlas' services will do our utmost to help the community, including researchers and academic societies all over Japan, to become even more energetic. We will continue to strive to develop services that exceed customer expectations and that people will like when they use them."

While Dave handled facilitating, writing, and client relations, Kathy assumed the formidable challenge of developing the company’s infrastructure from the ground up, including all aspects related to finance, human resources, operations, and, as her pseudo-title implies, putting out the occasional “fire” (figuratively speaking, of course; we have a strict “No Fire Bugs” hiring policy). While she’s far too humble to admit it, Kathy’s success as a business leader is not by accident: with a B.A. in Marketing from The Ohio State University, Kathy held management positions with The Collection, Paul Harris, and Petite Sophisticate retail apparel purveyors, as well as American Greetings before establishing automätik. And, as any “Fire Chief” worth her salt, Kathy is gifted at recognizing, diagnosing, and solving issues and problems, and has an amazing ability to tactfully communicate in the “heat of the battle.”"

She first started in the entertainment business at the age of 12, when she began modeling and acting.  By age 17, she landed an international modeling contract that relocated her to Japan.  Upon her return to the states, she fell in love with the other side of the business.  She enjoyed being behind the scenes as much as she enjoyed being in front of the camera. She was hired by a local talent agency, while she was still modeling part-time.  Beginning in model development (training the new talent), she worked her way up to booking talent. Many years were spent learning the ropes of the business. Eventually, Barbara landed her dream job as she was selected to travel the southeast making appearances as a *real* Mattel “Barbie” (which is really kind of funny because all her close friends call her “Barbie!”) Barbara’s passion for art was ignited when she met her husband, Keelan.  Although she can’t draw much more than a stick figure, she has always been amazed by his talent!  She is a 10+ year member of the International Live Events Association (ILEA) and served on the board for 2 years. Barbara is also a member of National Association of Catering and Events (NACE).  She has become the “go-to” person for clients looking for live, visual, artistic entertainment. Representing dozens of talented Artists, she can pair her clients with any type of talent they are looking for!"

While still in high school, Aba’s uncle developed a spinal problem that saw him get immobilized for months. Aba watched as orthopedists, through surgery and medication, helped her uncle regain his full mobility. This fascinated Aba and at that point, she chose to become a doctor, specifically an orthopedic surgeon. She worked hard at the sciences and was admitted to medical school before taking a 5-year residency to perfect her skills. To actualize her dreams of offering medical care under her own terms, Dr. Aba decided to go into private practice and has since become one of the best orthopedic surgeons in Dover, Delaware. Dr. Aba is known for performing spinal surgeries on both children and adults, as well as performing procedures to remove both benign and cancerous. She is also proficient in the management of non-spine oncological issues in both children and adults. In her career, Dr. Aba has helped many people get back to normal health after going through various spinal problems that would have otherwise immobilized them for life. Besides her work as an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Aba is also quite big on philanthropy. Over the years, she has given thousands of dollars to charities that help people from poor backgrounds access orthopedic care. She also actively volunteers to help such people access medical care that they would never afford. In her career, she has been to many countries where she has offered her services for free to some of the most vulnerable groups on the planet. She also occasionally treats homeless people that do not have insurance to access her services but need them. Besides medical work and philanthropy, Dr. Aba is also into golfing and is a member of multiple golf clubs in Delaware and across the country.  She is also into hiking and has been to some of the most challenging hiking trails in the U.S and beyond. It helps her unwind while also bonding with her husband, who also loves hiking."

Growing up as the son of a grain trader at the Chicago Board of Trade, Jack has had a fascination with and been involved in markets for most of his life.

These decades of experience in financial markets have included epic bull markets periodically interrupted by such things as the worst one-day stock market crash in history not to mention the worst financial crisis since the Depression. The ups and downs have helped form Jack’s belief in the importance of implementing systematic strategies that keep the emotions out of investing. Jack continues his love affair with markets as an avid reader and occasional writer on all things related to markets and economics. Jack earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University before going on to attain a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

David Marley, began developing solar projects in 2008 after he installed an 88 kW rooftop solar array at his construction company’s new headquarters in Amherst, MA. Dave’s quest for answers as to how he could generate more power than his rooftop system led him to look downward, off the roof, for more square footage. Born and raised in Massachusetts, Dave knew that there was no scrub or unused land in New England as is the case in other parts of the United States.  Any large scale solar production in the northeast would have to either take the land out of production, which can be very expensive or, better yet, co-exist with productive land.    So in 2009 Dave began working with experts at University of Massachusetts Amherst to conduct research and test the theory that solar arrays can be installed over farmland while allowing the crops below to grow unaffected. Once this theory was proven, the next big hurdle was to devise a system that allowed construction without disrupting fertile land. Tradition holds that structures are anchored in the earth using concrete. Put very simply, concrete and farm land don’t mix well. Dave had to devise a system that anchored the load without concrete. The system also had to account for farmers occasionally changing or rotating crops, and it had to be inexpensive to install and maintain. Dave and his team set out to engineer and test such a design."

The client's challenge was an understaffed HR Department, employees who didn't fully understand or appreciate the benefits provided to them, and no way to fund a viable solution.  Don's vision was to 'insource' a Benefit Communication Specialist (BCS) within the client's HR Department to handle all benefit communication and enrollment for the client, freeing the current HR staff to focus on more strategic priorities of their company.  The dedicated additional personnel were funded by an offering of voluntary benefits as part of the employees' complete benefits package.  This unique communication and enrollment model brought like minds together by way of collaboration on a large hospital account with Rich Reda of Lockton Benefits.  As a result of that fortuitous opportunity in 2003, Don and Rich founded Benefit Communication Insourcing.

Ethel’s tireless efforts resulted in the Nurses Registration Act 1919, which brought nurses together under one profession. Ethel was born in Morayshire, Scotland, on 26 January 1857. Her father, Dr Davidson Manson, died when she was a baby and three years later her mother, Harriette, married George Storar, a Member of Parliament for South Nottinghamshire. Mr Storar became the only father Ethel knew. Ethel grew up with culture, refinement and wealth. A woman ahead of her time A young woman with her advantages wouldn’t have been expected to work. But Ethel had intellect, determination and courage. She was a gifted public speaker and an articulate writer – in many ways, she was ahead of her time. She wanted to work, and she chose to dedicate her life to nursing. The social class structure in Britain during Ethel’s time determined access to education and the speed of career progression in nursing. Some could train free as ordinary probationers and earn a salary. Others like Ethel, who could afford fees, could train as paying probationers, and enjoy steady career progression. In 1878, a 21-year-old Ethel started training as a paying probationer at the Children’s Hospital in Nottingham. After a year, she moved to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, before earning a promotion to sister at the London Hospital in Whitechapel. She passed hospital inspections with flying colours. Her wards were organised, efficient and clean. Patients appeared cared for and respected."

Commercial Real Estate Success Pacifica assembled a portfolio in those markets through acquisition and, as the cycles progressed, development with private and eventually institutional investors. Later, as prices became inflated in each market and reached extreme levels, Pacifica sold its holdings and looked elsewhere for opportunity. Following a successful cycle in LA, Pacifica Colorado eventually established the largest private commercial portfolio in that state. By 1998, as market values began to peak, Pacifica sold its 8 million square foot portfolio and management business for approximately $750 million. Pacifica’s principals then returned to the LA area and established its second major Los Angeles portfolio of approximately 4 million square feet.

He has worked with clients ranging from large brands to small emerging growth companies. Throughout his career in marketing communications, Dan’s commitment to his clients’ success and his passion for the use of innovation and the latest technologies in achieving marketing excellence have continued to define his outlook on communications. Dan started his professional career with Ketchum Communications, a leading global public relations firm, in Washington, DC, before moving next to a role in public relations for a large health-care association. During his career in traditional marketing, Dan conducted successful public relations campaigns resulting in high visibility for his clients. During this time, Dan also conducted marketing and media strategy training events, fueling Dan’s natural teaching/coaching strengths along with his passion for marketing. In the early 1990s, Dan moved into the emerging area of digital communications: “I was drawn to the way desktop publishing was allowing marketing communications professionals to create compelling print publications without the use of highly specialized traditional graphic design techniques. This was the dawn of digital empowerment,” said Dan. “This was the early days of desktop publishing. We were teaching clients how to use these brand new tools including Ventura, PageMaker and Quark.” Dan and other innovators using digital publishing quickly embraced the new world of online media. “I can still remember going to a conference hosted by AOL teaching business professionals about the new publishing capabilities of the web. There was a certain palpable energy that was part of that new age of the Net and the potential to create new channels of communication,” Dan continued. Dan saw the convergence of traditional and digital communications as an area of vast potential and excitement. In 1998, when the internet was in its early days, Dan began to put his passion for marketing to work in helping companies build their online presence. “By today’s standards, we were building simple brochureware websites, but more importantly, we were helping companies to market their online presence to reach new audiences and markets.  This wasn’t just about creating a website.  It was about developing new ways to attract potential customers for our clients,” said Dan. The big issue in those early days of the web was that very few companies were actually focused on developing online marketing programs for the websites they were creating.  The concept was that if you built it, they would come.  Of course, this approach seldom worked.  In response to this need, Dan left the safe confines of corporate America in early 2000 to build the digital marketing consulting practice which gave birth to Zephoria. More than a decade later, there is a whole new world of online marketing communication and Zephoria is at the forefront of it.  Even though the tactics have changed and evolved over the past 25 years, the underlying critical nature of finding a need and communicating a measurable and action-oriented message have remained constant.  Dan’s passion and commitment to continual evolution and learning has only grown stronger, and so has his passion for working with companies to achieve marketing success."

It all started with his own pets: After trying to take a feral cat to the shelter and finding that they would not take her, he took compassion and decided to take her home. The cat and his border collie/lab mix (also a rescue from the SPCA) became the best of friends. After seeing firsthand what an impact you can have on an animal’s life, he decided to see how he could continue to give back to the community. Having studied in the field of criminal justice for a couple years, Brent Kloecker has been able to apply that to how he lives his life. On top of animal rights, he also regularly gives presents to unfortunate children in Mexico and gives readily to the homeless. He has also mentored and given his time to supporting recovering addicts, alcoholics, and divorced men as well as donated to the local law enforcement office. In his free time, Brent Kloecker enjoys mountain biking, art, and attending church. ''"
